                <p>Sanya,</p>
                <p>I know I've made mistakes, and have hurt you with words or actions I wish I could take back. I'm truly sorry. You mean so much to me, and not a day goes by without me wishing I could've done better.</p>
                <p>Ik sanya u r dealing with things, and in all this I am sorry instead of making u feel better, I always end up hurting u. I am sorry for everything, and maybe u don't want to talk to me,i deserve it. Atleast u won't be hurt. I just want u to be happy and and smiling. It's fine whatever it takes.Just remember I am always here for u, and uk i will be the first one standing for u always.<p>
                <p>I miss us, and I hope we can move forward together â€” stronger, brighter. Like sunflowers, always turning to the light.</p>
                <p>Happy Birthday once again and seeyaa soon...</p>
